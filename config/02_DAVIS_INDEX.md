## Index of the interesting

> **A story is interesting when it denies or overturns an audience’s taken-for-granted assumptions.**

Not when it confirms them.  
Not when it explains them clearly.  
Not when it is merely true.

Interest is generated by **assumption violation**.

Everything below is a _specific form_ of that violation.

---

## I. Fundamental Traits of Interesting Stories

### 1. Assumption Reversal (The Prime Trait)

A story becomes interesting when it asserts:

- _What seems obvious is false_
    
- _What seems marginal is central_
    
- _What seems bad is good (or vice versa)_
    

> If the audience says “I never thought of it that way,” interest has been achieved.

---

### 2. Contrast With the Taken-for-Granted World

An interesting story **attacks the background reality** the audience assumes is normal, natural, or inevitable.

- Customs treated as eternal are shown to be recent
    
- Systems treated as rational are shown to be accidental
    
- Moral judgments treated as self-evident are shown to be constructed
    

---

### 3. Violation of Common Sense Without Absurdity

The story must contradict expectation **without becoming nonsense**.

- It must feel _wrong at first_
    
- But _inevitable in hindsight_
    

This is why bad twists fail: they shock but do not cohere.

---

## II. Structural Traits of Interesting Stories

_(Davis’s “Index of the Interesting,” translated into narrative terms)_

### 4. Hidden Order Revealed

**What appears chaotic is actually structured.**

Stories that:

- Reveal systems beneath disorder
    
- Show patterns beneath noise
    
- Expose coherence where randomness was assumed
    

Example pattern:

> “Everyone thought X was messy and unorganized. In fact, it follows a strict internal logic.”

---

### 5. Apparent Order Exposed as Illusion

**What appears stable or rational is actually fragmented or incoherent.**

Stories that:

- Deconstruct institutions
    
- Expose myths of efficiency
    
- Reveal fragility beneath authority
    

Example:

> “What looked like a well-designed system survives only through constant emergency repair.”

---

### 6. The One Is Actually Many

**What seems unified is composed of distinct, conflicting elements.**

- A character who is not “one thing”
    
- A movement that contains opposing motives
    
- A decision driven by multiple hidden incentives
    

This creates narrative depth and moral ambiguity.

---

### 7. The Many Are Actually One

**What appears diverse or complex reduces to a single underlying force.**

- Multiple conflicts driven by the same fear
    
- Different characters reenacting the same pattern
    
- Separate events revealed as manifestations of one cause
    

This creates narrative elegance and inevitability.

---

### 8. The Individual Is Actually the System

**Personal stories that reveal structural forces.**

- A character’s flaw turns out to be socially produced
    
- A private struggle reflects a public condition
    
- Psychology is inseparable from environment
    

This is where biography becomes sociology.

---

### 9. The System Is Actually the Individual

**Large-scale forces traced back to human motives.**

- Institutions driven by pride, fear, envy, status
    
- Abstract systems revealed as human decisions repeated at scale
    

This is where abstraction becomes dramatic.

---

## III. Temporal Traits (Change Over Time)

### 10. Stability Is Actually Change

**What seems permanent is shown to be temporary.**

- Traditions revealed as recent inventions
    
- “How it’s always been” exposed as myth
    

---

### 11. Change Is Actually Stability

**What seems revolutionary preserves the same structure.**

- New language, same power
    
- New technology, same incentives
    
- New regime, old logic
    

This produces narrative irony.

---

## IV. Functional Traits (Means and Ends)

### 12. Dysfunction That Works

**What appears broken actually succeeds at its real purpose.**

- Institutions that fail publicly but succeed privately
    
- Systems designed to look ineffective but serve hidden goals
    

This is one of the most powerful narrative engines in nonfiction.

---

### 13. Function That Fails

**What claims to work does not.**

- Systems that exist mainly to signal virtue
    
- Processes that persist despite failure because they serve status or control
    

---

## V. Moral & Evaluative Traits

### 14. The Bad Is Actually Good

Stories that:

- Reframe vice as adaptive
    
- Recast failure as formative
    
- Show suffering as productive (without romanticizing it)
    

---

### 15. The Good Is Actually Bad

Stories that:

- Expose unintended harm
    
- Reveal moral blind spots
    
- Undermine sentimental narratives
    

This is where backlash often occurs—interest increases with risk.

---

## VI. Relational Traits (Between Phenomena)

### 16. Unexpected Correlation

**Things assumed unrelated are deeply connected.**

- Culture ↔ economics
    
- Technology ↔ morality
    
- Architecture ↔ psychology
    

These stories expand the reader’s causal imagination.

---

### 17. Expected Correlation That Doesn’t Exist

**Things assumed to go together do not.**

- Love without compatibility
    
- Education without wisdom
    
- Progress without improvement
    

This produces cognitive tension.

---

### 18. Coexistence of Apparent Contradictions

**Things thought incompatible actually coexist.**

- Freedom and control
    
- Faith and doubt
    
- Order and chaos
    

These stories feel “adult” because they resist simplification.

---

## VII. Dialectical Traits (Opposites)

### 19. The Opposite Is True

**What looks like X is actually not-X.**

- Strength as weakness
    
- Liberation as dependency
    
- Rationality as ritual
    

This is the engine behind the most memorable chapter titles.

---

### 20. Reversal of Cause and Effect

**What seems causal is actually the consequence.**

- Behavior shaping belief, not the reverse
    
- Institutions creating needs they claim to serve
    

This trait is especially powerful in explanatory nonfiction.

---

## VIII. What Makes a Story _Not_ Interesting (Crucial)

A story fails when it:

- Merely confirms what the audience already believes
    
- Adds detail without altering understanding
    
- Accumulates facts without challenging assumptions
    
- Says “everything you think is correct”
    

Davis is explicit: **truth alone does not generate interest**.
