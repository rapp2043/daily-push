SUBJECT LINE: Why the Best Diabetes Drug Isn't Really a Diabetes Drug

The story begins, as so many medical stories do, with a number on a screen. John, a 62-year-old retired teacher from Omaha, sat in his endocrinologist’s office in the spring of 2022 and stared at the result of his latest A1C test. It was a measure of his average blood sugar over three months, and for years, it had been a relentless marker of his type 2 diabetes, stubbornly hovering in the high 8s. That day, it was 6.1. He was on a new medication called semaglutide, and it was working with a startling efficacy. He had lost nearly thirty pounds without trying. His energy was up. For the first time in a decade, his diabetes felt like a condition he could manage, not a force that managed him. But the most surprising conversation came six months later, during his annual check-up with his cardiologist. After reviewing an echocardiogram, the doctor looked up, puzzled. “Whatever you’re doing,” he said, “your heart function looks better. Significantly better.” John wasn’t just treating his diabetes. Unbeknownst to him, he was undergoing a profound form of heart therapy.

We like to think of medicine as a precise endeavor. A drug is developed for a specific condition—an antibiotic for an infection, a statin for cholesterol, insulin for diabetes. It’s a clean, logical, cause-and-effect worldview. It turns out, that’s not how it works at all. The history of medicine is not a history of targeted missiles, but of unexpected collisions and fortunate accidents. Semaglutide, sold under names like Ozempic and Wegovy, was engineered to mimic a hormone that regulates blood sugar and appetite. Its primary job, its reason for being, was to lower glucose levels in people with diabetes. But then something strange happened. In large, multi-year trials designed to ensure the drug’s cardiovascular safety—a standard requirement for new diabetes medications—a different narrative emerged. The drug wasn’t just safe for the heart; it appeared to be actively protecting it. In one landmark trial, it reduced the risk of major cardiac events like heart attack and stroke by a staggering twenty percent.[^1] This wasn’t a subtle side note. It was a headline. A diabetes drug was, by the numbers, one of the most effective heart drugs in a generation.

So what are we to make of this? How does a medication designed for the pancreas speak so directly to the heart? The answer lies not in the drug itself, but in a fundamental flaw in how we have categorized disease for the last century. We have treated diabetes and cardiovascular disease as separate entities, managed by different specialists in different wings of the hospital. One is a disorder of metabolism; the other, of plumbing. But what if they are, in essence, two symptoms of the same underlying syndrome? What if the river of insulin resistance and inflammation that floods the body in type 2 diabetes is the very same river that, miles downstream, erodes the arterial walls and strains the heart muscle?

This idea isn’t new, but it has been waiting for a tool dramatic enough to prove it. For decades, the link was circumstantial, epidemiological. Doctors knew that having diabetes made you far more likely to have a heart attack. They called it a “risk factor,” a term that speaks to correlation, not causation. The old guard of diabetes drugs, like sulfonylureas or even insulin itself, could bring blood sugar numbers down with impressive force. But they did nothing to change the ultimate fate of the patient’s heart. In some cases, they even made things worse by promoting weight gain. They were treating the number on the screen, not the sickness in the system. The new class of drugs to which semaglutide belongs, called GLP-1 receptor agonists, does something different. It doesn’t just force sugar out of the blood; it engages with the body’s broader signaling systems for metabolism and satiety. It lowers blood sugar, yes, but it also reduces weight, blood pressure, and inflammation. It isn’t attacking a single branch of the disease. It is quietly calming the root.

Here’s a thought experiment. Imagine you are an engineer presented with two identical, complex machines. Both are overheating and making a worrying grinding noise. One engineer is told the problem is “overheating.” He attaches a powerful fan. The machine cools. The grinding continues, and eventually, a critical gear fails. The second engineer is told to fix the “grinding noise.” He applies a thick lubricant. The noise lessens, but the machine eventually melts down. Both engineers treated a symptom, congratulated themselves on lowering their specific number, and missed the real issue: a single, failed bearing that was causing both the friction and the heat. For years, cardiology and endocrinology have been those two engineers, working in separate shops, celebrating their individual fan or lubricant, while the patient—the whole machine—continued to break down.

The promise of semaglutide and drugs like it is that they seem to address the bearing. The dramatic reduction in heart disease isn’t a quirky side effect; it is the main event, revealing itself through the lens of diabetes. This is the classic Gladwellian reversal: what looks like a change—a new use for an old drug—is actually a revelation of a deep and stable truth. The conditions were never separate. We just had poor tools to see the connection. The drug is a biological probe, illuminating a hidden pathway shared by the pancreas, the brain, the liver, and the heart. It forces us to reconsider what we are even treating. Is semaglutide a diabetes drug with heart benefits, or is it a cardiovascular drug that happens to lower blood sugar? The distinction, once so critical to pharmacologists and insurance companies, begins to blur into meaninglessness.

John, our retired teacher, doesn’t think in these terms. He doesn’t care about disease taxonomies or pharmacological paradigms. He only knows that a single weekly injection gave him back a sense of control over his body and, according to his cardiologist, likely added years to his life. He started the drug to fix one number on a lab report. What he got was a repair of the system that produced that number in the first place. The story of this drug, then, is not merely a tale of medical serendipity. It is a lesson in humility. It suggests that the body is a network, not a collection of isolated components, and that the most powerful treatments may be those that listen to its interconnected whispers, rather than shouting at a single, solitary symptom. We went looking for a better way to manage diabetes. We stumbled upon a new way to understand health.

[^1]: This refers to the landmark SELECT trial (Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity), the results of which were presented in 2023. The actual magnitude of cardiovascular benefit for people with diabetes had been established earlier in trials like SUSTAIN-6 and LEADER for similar drugs, painting a consistent and surprising picture.
[^2]: This pattern of a diabetes drug revealing broader health benefits has a famous predecessor: metformin. Originally derived from the French lilac, it became a first-line therapy not only because it lowers blood sugar, but because it was associated with longer lifespans and reduced cancer risk in some populations. It was a hint, decades ago, that we were on the wrong taxonomic path.
[^3]: The economic and regulatory implications of this are profound. If a drug demonstrates a massive reduction in costly, deadly events like heart attacks, its value to the healthcare system skyrockets, potentially justifying its high price tag in a way that “just” lowering blood sugar never could. It shifts the calculus entirely.
