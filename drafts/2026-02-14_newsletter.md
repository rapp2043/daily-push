SUBJECT LINE: How Cracking Down on Secret Bank Accounts Made Crime Worse

Andrew Peterson spent months staring at a river of numbers. Not literal numbers, of course, but millions of anonymized financial messages flowing through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication—the SWIFT network that forms the central nervous system of global capital. Peterson, a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, was part of a team digging into a paradox. For years, governments and watchdog groups had been pressuring traditional offshore tax havens—places like the Cayman Islands or Switzerland—to tighten their rules on secret banking. The goal was straightforward: to starve criminals, terrorists, and corrupt officials of their channels to launder money. The assumption was that if you squeeze the offshore system, illicit finance will diminish. But as Peterson traced the patterns in the data, a different, more troubling story emerged. The money didn’t vanish. It simply went somewhere else.[^1]

But here’s the problem with that theory—the comforting idea that regulatory pressure uniformly reduces bad behavior. It turns out that sophisticated financial networks operate less like a balloon you deflate and more like a volume of water you try to contain. Squeeze one area, and the flow merely redirects, seeking the path of least resistance. Peterson and his colleagues, including economists from Princeton, published work suggesting that as regulations tightened on classic offshore havens after the 2016 Panama Papers scandal, something peculiar happened. Illicit financial activity, rather than shrinking, began to migrate. It moved to locations with less scrutiny, different vulnerabilities, and often, right back into the heart of the very countries trying to fight it. The crackdown, in other words, didn’t eradicate the problem. It displaced it.

This pattern should feel familiar, because we’ve seen it before in a very different arena. Nearly a century ago, the United States embarked on another grand experiment in prohibition. The Volstead Act, which ushered in the era of Prohibition in 1920, was designed to eliminate the scourge of alcohol. The assumption was simple: ban the product, and you eliminate the associated crime and social ills. But what happened? The demand for alcohol didn’t evaporate. It was met by a new, vastly more dangerous and organized supply chain. Small-time saloons were replaced by violent criminal syndicates. Bathtub gin, often poisonous, replaced regulated liquor. The law enforcement pressure didn’t stop the trade; it amplified its risks, its profits, and its brutality. Criminals adapted, finding new methods and new routes. The policy had a profound unintended consequence: it created modern organized crime.

And then something strange happened in the world of finance. As international pressure mounted on offshore havens, a similar adaptation began. The research suggests that entities looking to obscure wealth started to avoid the now-scrutinized traditional pathways. They didn’t give up. They innovated. One method was to shift to havens that were less conspicuous or had different legal frameworks. Another, more subtle shift was toward the use of complex, opaque corporate structures within major economies themselves—like the United States. Several studies and investigative reports have pointed out that it can be easier to set up an anonymous shell company in certain U.S. states than in notorious offshore jurisdictions. The money, in a sense, came home, hiding not in a tropical bank vault but in a filing cabinet in Delaware or Wyoming, wrapped in layers of legal paperwork. The regulatory squeeze offshore had the perverse effect of pushing illicit finance into the domestic banking system, where it becomes harder to distinguish from legitimate activity.

So what would you do? Imagine you have a substantial amount of money obtained through corruption. A decade ago, the playbook was clear: route it through a series of shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, park it in a private Swiss bank account, and perhaps invest it in London real estate. Today, that route is floodlit. Compliance officers at banks are trained to flag those transactions. International treaties require more disclosure. Your old map is obsolete. Where do you go? You might look at gold dealers in a region with weak oversight, or invest in high-value, easily transportable assets like artwork or cryptocurrency. You might exploit the fact that while banks are heavily monitored, other sectors—like real estate brokers or luxury car dealers—are not subject to the same stringent "know your customer" rules. The pressure didn’t eliminate your options; it just forced you to find newer, and in some ways more fragile and destabilizing, ones.

This is the brutal logic of displacement, and it reveals a critical flaw in how we think about policing complex systems. We tend to view crackdowns in isolation, as targeted strikes on a static enemy. But the enemy is not static. It is adaptive. Economists sometimes call this the "waterbed effect": push down in one spot, and it rises in another. In criminology, it’s known as the "balloon effect," observed in drug interdiction—when enforcement intensifies along one smuggling route, traffic simply shifts to another. Peterson’s financial data appears to be documenting the same phenomenon in high finance. The immense cost and effort of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, which runs into the tens of billions of dollars annually for banks alone, may be successfully hardening certain targets. But the overall volume of illicit finance, estimated to be in the trillions globally, seems to persist, simply flowing toward the softer targets.[^2]

The historical lesson of Prohibition and the modern data from financial researchers point to the same sobering principle: a crackdown that focuses solely on the *method* without addressing the underlying *demand* or the full spectrum of vulnerabilities can often backfire. It can create more diffuse, less predictable, and sometimes more dangerous forms of the very activity it aimed to suppress. The 1920s saw alcohol distribution fall into the hands of violent cartels. Today, the displacement of dirty money into domestic markets or into unstable assets like certain cryptocurrencies could be increasing systemic financial risk and making illicit wealth harder than ever to track. The goal of starving criminals of resources is noble, but the outcome is messier than we assumed. The system, when squeezed, doesn’t just contract. It morphs.

Andrew Peterson’s river of SWIFT messages, then, is more than just data. It’s a current map of an endless adaptation. It shows that for every new rule written in Washington or Brussels, a new loophole is explored in a lawyer’s office or a programmer’s garage. The financial system, much like the market for prohibited goods a century ago, is a living ecosystem. You cannot change one parameter and expect a simple, linear result. You get cascading, unintended consequences. The researchers didn’t find evidence that the war on dirty money was being lost. Instead, they found something more nuanced and perhaps more challenging: the battlefield was constantly, intelligently, shifting. And the enemy had quietly moved to a new front, one that was, in many ways, right under our noses.

[^1]: SWIFT is a cooperative society based in Belgium that provides a secure messaging system for over 11,000 financial institutions to send instructions about cross-border payments. It does not hold money itself, but its data is a near-comprehensive record of global capital flows, making it an invaluable, if anonymized, resource for researchers like Peterson.
[^2]: This is analogous to what scholars have called the "Iron Law of Prohibition": the harder the enforcement, the more potent the banned substance becomes. During alcohol prohibition, drinkers shifted from beer to hard liquor. During the war on drugs, marijuana potency increased. In finance, as basic hiding places are closed, the methods for hiding wealth become more complex and potentially more destabilizing to the broader system.
