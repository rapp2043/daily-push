SUBJECT LINE: The Confidence Thieves: How Thinking Too Hard Can Make You Less Sure

It was March 27, 1977, on the runway of Los Rodeos Airport in Tenerife. Captain Jacob Veldhuyzen van Zanten, KLM’s chief flight instructor and a poster-boy for Dutch aviation, sat in the cockpit of a Boeing 747. He was, by any measure, a supremely confident man. His colleagues called him “God.” On this fog-shrouded tarmac, air traffic control gave him a lengthy, ambiguous instruction for taxiing. His younger flight engineer, wary, heard the instruction differently and voiced his concern. He suggested they might not actually have clearance for takeoff. Van Zanten, immersed in the complex mental calculus of fuel, timing, and regulations, dismissed him. He had thought it through. His confidence was absolute. Minutes later, his aircraft collided with another 747, resulting in the deadliest accident in aviation history.[^1]

We like to believe that confidence is the reward for careful thought. The more you ponder a problem, the more information you gather, the more certain you become. It’s the foundation of everything from exam preparation to military strategy: analyze, then act. Doubt is for the unprepared. But here’s what’s strange. A quiet body of research suggests that for a significant number of people, the very act of thinking things through doesn’t build confidence—it systematically steals it away.

The central puzzle is this: why does the same cognitive process—deep reflection—produce such diametrically opposite results in different people? One person ruminates on their golf swing and becomes convinced they’ve unlocked the secret; another ruminates and becomes sure they’ll never improve. One student reviews their exam notes and feels ready; another reviews the same material and is seized by panic. It feels random, a temperamental roll of the dice. But what if it isn’t? What if there is a pattern to who gains confidence from thought and who has it eroded?

The answer begins to take shape when you look not at *what* people think, but *how* they think about their own thinking. Researchers sometimes talk about two broad modes of introspection. The first is *problem-oriented*: thought as a targeted tool for solving a discrete puzzle. The second is *self-evaluative*: thought as a swirling, often critical audit of one’s own abilities and worth. The crucial finding is that the people who lose confidence from thinking are often stuck in the second mode. Their reflection isn’t parsing a problem “out there”; it’s conducting a performance review on the person doing the parsing. And as anyone who has endured a brutal performance review knows, the feedback isn’t always constructive.

This explains the asymmetry. When you think in a problem-oriented way, you accumulate evidence—you solve parts of the puzzle. Your confidence grows with each small victory. But when your thinking is self-evaluative, you often accumulate *doubts*. You don’t see the puzzle; you see your own clumsy fingers fumbling with the pieces. Every unanswered question isn’t a challenge to be solved; it’s proof of your inadequacy. The thinking, in this mode, becomes a machine for manufacturing insecurity.

We can see this play out in a famous, almost cruel, piece of psychological research. The Dunning-Kruger effect describes how people with the lowest ability in a domain—logic, grammar, humor—often have the highest confidence in their skills. They are too incompetent to recognize their own incompetence. Their internal audit is a sham; they lack the very tools to conduct it. But consider the flip side, the often-overlooked corollary: the people with the highest ability often suffer from *lower* confidence than you’d expect. They know enough to see the vast expanse of what they don’t know. Their self-evaluation is rigorous and unforgiving. Their deep thought doesn’t yield certainty; it yields a profound sense of the complexity they have yet to master.

So which one are you? Here’s a simple thought experiment. Imagine you’ve just finished a difficult exam. You have an hour before you can forget about it. Do you spend that hour replaying the questions, trying to reconstruct your answers and gauge how you did? Or do you put it out of your mind entirely and go for a walk? Your instinct probably reveals your style. The replayer is inviting a self-evaluative spiral. The walker is instinctively avoiding it. And the walker, research suggests, will often emerge with more stable confidence, regardless of their actual score.

This isn’t just about anxiety. It’s about the architecture of attention. The brain has a limited bandwidth for conscious thought. When that bandwidth is consumed by the drama of self-evaluation—*Am I good enough? Did I sound stupid? What do they think of me?*—there’s little left for cold, clear problem-solving. The mental energy that should be directed outward, at the challenge, gets turned inward, against the self. It’s a cognitive civil war. And in that war, confidence is the first casualty.

History is littered with the wreckage of those who thought too much in the wrong way. Take the world of competitive chess. Grandmasters don’t just see more moves ahead than amateurs; they *think differently* about the game. Studies of their eye movements show they focus on the structural relationships between pieces, not on frantically evaluating their own impending blunder. An amateur, in the same position, is often locked in a self-evaluative panic: *I’m going to lose my rook. I’m terrible at this. Why did I come here?* The amateur is thinking, furiously. But they are thinking in a way that guarantees their confidence will evaporate move by move. The grandmaster’s confidence is rooted in a thinking process that is almost entirely exterior.[^2]

This brings us back to the foggy runway at Tenerife. Captain van Zanten was not an incompetent man. He was, by all accounts, brilliant. But in that moment, his thinking had a particular quality. He was not merely processing air traffic instructions. He was likely thinking as the chief instructor, the man who wrote the manuals, the figure known as “God.” His cognitive process was saturated with his own identity and stature. The flight engineer’s warning was just another piece of data to be weighed and dismissed by a supreme intellect. Van Zanten’s confidence grew with every second of his own analysis. It was the ultimate, tragic example of problem-oriented thinking corrupted by a towering, unassailable self-evaluation. He was so confident in *himself* that he lost the problem.

The lesson isn’t that we should stop thinking. It’s that we must learn to notice the flavor of our own thoughts. Are we analyzing the problem, or are we auditing our own worth? Are we gathering evidence, or collecting indictments? The difference determines whether our reflections will be a source of power or a slow leak of doubt. Confidence doesn’t come from thinking more. It comes from thinking right.

[^1]: The Tenerife disaster remains a foundational case study in Crew Resource Management (CRM), the science of how human factors, not just technical skill, contribute to airline safety. Van Zanten’s perceived infallibility created a “power gradient” so steep his junior officer felt he could only hint at his concern, not state it clearly.
[^2]: This exterior-focused thinking may be getting harder. Some sociologists point to the “Flynn effect”—the decades-long rise in IQ scores—stalling or reversing in some developed nations. One hypothesis is that our modern environment, with its constant stream of evaluative feedback (likes, grades, performance metrics), trains us in self-evaluative thinking from a young age, potentially at the expense of the deep, problem-oriented cognition that drives fluid intelligence.
