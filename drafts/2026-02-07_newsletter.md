SUBJECT LINE: The Ozone Hole We Fixed Is Filling With Something Worse

***

Susan Solomon was colder than she had ever been in her life. It was August of 1986, and she was standing on the barren, windswept ice of Antarctica, nearly two miles above sea level. The air was so thin and frigid it hurt to breathe. She and her team had hauled delicate scientific instruments to the bottom of the world, to a place called McMurdo Station, to answer a single, baffling question: what was causing a massive, continent-sized hole to open up each spring in the Earth’s protective ozone layer? The conventional wisdom of the time pointed fingers at natural cycles or sunspots. But Solomon, an atmospheric chemist, had a different culprit in mind. Her experiments in that brutal cold confirmed it. The villain was a class of miraculous, seemingly harmless human-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons—CFCs. They were in our air conditioners, our aerosol cans, our refrigerators. And they were quietly shredding the planet’s sunscreen. Her work became the bedrock of one of the most celebrated environmental triumphs in history: the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which phased out CFCs and saved the ozone layer. We like to tell that story as a parable of human ingenuity and global cooperation. A problem identified, a solution engineered, a disaster averted. It’s a comforting narrative of good policy defeating bad chemistry. But there’s a problem with that story. It turns out, in our urgent search for a solution, we may have quietly unleashed a different, and perhaps more insidious, chemical plague.

The Montreal Protocol didn’t just ban CFCs; it mandated a search for substitutes. The chemical industry needed new compounds that could do the same job—absorb heat, suppress flames, act as solvents—without those pesky ozone-destroying chlorine atoms. The answer emerged in the form of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) for cooling, and a vast, sprawling family of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, for other industrial uses. PFAS were engineering marvels. Their molecular structure, a chain of carbon atoms bonded to fluorine, was one of the strongest in organic chemistry. Nothing seemed to stick to them. Water beaded right off. Grease and stains couldn’t penetrate. They were, in the parlance that would later haunt us, *forever chemicals*. They didn’t break down in the environment. Or in our bodies. They were the perfect embodiment of the solution we thought we needed. And so, with the ozone emergency as a backdrop, their production skyrocketed.

Now, let’s pause for a moment. Put yourself in the shoes of a policymaker in 1987. You have incontrovertible evidence that the current chemicals are actively destroying a vital part of the atmosphere, increasing rates of skin cancer, and damaging ecosystems. The chemical industry arrives with new compounds that perform the same functions and, crucially, pose *zero threat to the ozone layer*. The tests they show you indicate lower toxicity. What do you do? You approve them. You celebrate them. You’ve solved the crisis at hand. This is the first, and most forgivable, unintended consequence: the **Solution Blindspot**. We become so fixated on solving the primary, visible problem that we lack the framework, or the political will, to rigorously stress-test the replacement for a whole new universe of potential failures. The mission was “find something that doesn’t hurt the ozone layer.” The mission was not, and could not have been, “find something that is benign in every conceivable way for all time.”

The consequences of that blindspot began to seep into the world. PFAS didn’t vanish into the stratosphere like CFCs; they seeped into everything here on the ground. A 2024 study published in *Nature Geoscience* made a startling connection.[^1] It revealed that the same “fluorinated” gases we developed to replace ozone-harming chemicals are now the dominant source of a particularly persistent type of PFAS pollution found in rainwater, snowpack, and even remote Arctic ice. These chemicals, used in refrigerants, solvents, and blowing agents for insulation, are traveling globally and degrading into terminal PFAS compounds that last forever. They are, in essence, the chemical legacy of our ozone rescue mission. We traded an atmospheric crisis for a hydrological one, swapping a hole in the sky for a poison in our water.

This leads us to the second category of consequence: the **Law of Conservation of Impact**. In environmental engineering, impact rarely disappears; it just changes form. A chemical that is inert and non-toxic in the lower atmosphere might be reactive and destructive higher up (like CFCs). Conversely, a chemical that is stable and safe for the ozone layer might be biologically persistent and accumulative in the food web (like PFAS). The problem isn't that chemists are malevolent; it's that the world is a complex, interconnected system. You can't alter one variable without affecting a dozen others in ways that are devilishly hard to predict. Researchers tracking Arctic snowpack have found that levels of some of these replacement-derived PFAS are now so high they exceed international safety guidelines for drinking water. The impact conserved itself, migrating from the stratosphere to the snowmelt.

So, what happens when we discover this new problem? We trigger the third phase: the **Whack-a-Mole Cycle of Regulation**. We banned CFCs. Then we discovered HFCs, while not ozone-killers, were potent greenhouse gases, thousands of times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. So, we amended the Montreal Protocol to phase out HFCs. Now we are in the early, agonizing stages of recognizing the PFAS crisis. Several thousand PFAS compounds exist, and we are trying to regulate them not as a single class, but in small, slow groups, while industry develops a new generation of “short-chain” or “fluorinated” replacements. The cycle is seductive. It feels like progress. Each new chemical is a testament to our ability to diagnose and respond. But from a distance, it looks like we are running in place, forever one step behind the unintended consequences of our last fix.

What are we to make of this? The lesson of CFCs and PFAS is not that the Montreal Protocol was a mistake. It was, and remains, a monumental success. It is that there are no clean victories in our tangled, technological world. Every solution is a bargain, a trade-off whose full price may only become apparent decades later. The brilliant chemicals that saved us from one future are now forcing us to confront another. Susan Solomon’s work in the Antarctic cold helped us heal the sky. But the legacy of the fix she helped inspire is now traceable in the very ice of that continent, a permanent chemical signature of our relentless, imperfect ingenuity. We solved for chlorine, and unleashed fluorine. We patched the hole, and invented forever.

[^1]: This is the critical study linking so-called "fluorinated" replacement gases—direct descendants of the Montreal Protocol's mandate—to widespread PFAS pollution. The researchers used ice core and snowpack data from the Arctic, Tibet, and Antarctica to trace the atmospheric transport and degradation of these compounds into persistent PFAS. It’s a stark example of a global, systems-level unintended consequence.
