SUBJECT LINE: The Hidden Logic of Our Strangest Rituals

The venture capitalist was known for many things—his preternatural sense for the next big platform, his ruthlessly short emails, his collection of vintage watches. But in the hours before a make-or-break board meeting, his team knew to look for one particular sign. He would disappear. Not to review figures or practice his pitch, but to walk, without fail, to a specific hot dog stand eight blocks from the office. He would order two dogs, with everything, eat them slowly on a park bench, and then return, ready to perform. It made no sense to his health-conscious, efficiency-obsessed colleagues. It was, they whispered, a compulsive tic, a bizarre habit he’d be better off breaking. But what if they had it completely backwards? What if the ritual wasn’t a bug in his system, but a critical feature?

We tend to think of compulsive behaviors—the checking, the counting, the little private rituals—as broken gears in the mind. They are “bad habits,” useless loops of action we’ve accidentally wired into our brains through repetition and reward. The logical prescription is to break the cycle, to suppress the urge, to replace the bad habit with a good one. This framework is so intuitive it feels like common sense. But here’s the problem with that theory: it fails to explain why some of the most demanding, high-stakes environments in the world are filled with people who cling to their compulsions like lifelines.

It turns out, that’s not how it works at all.

A team of neuroscientists and psychologists at UCLA recently decided to look at compulsive behavior not as a habit gone rogue, but as a possible tool. Their study, published in the journal *Nature Human Behaviour*, started from a simple but radical premise: what if these actions are not driven by a faulty “habit loop,” but are instead a deliberate, if subconscious, strategy for regulating unbearable inner states?[^1] The researchers designed experiments where participants faced uncertain, high-stress situations. They found that the development of repetitive, seemingly nonsensical actions wasn’t a sign of cognitive failure. It was a sign of the brain trying to *solve a problem*. The compulsion wasn’t the problem itself; it was the brain’s makeshift solution to the problem of chaos.

This idea that strange rituals impose order isn’t new; we’ve just historically called it by other names and reserved it for geniuses, not the rest of us. Consider the artist. Pablo Picasso, facing the terrifying blankness of a new canvas, didn’t just start painting. He engaged in a precise, daily ritual: rising at noon, working in silence until nightfall, and then, after dinner, reviewing his day’s work surrounded by his beloved dogs and old friends. The specific order of operations was non-negotiable. We call this “routine” when we admire it, and “compulsion” when we don’t understand its purpose. But both are attempts to wall off a corner of the unpredictable world and declare it manageable.

So why does the brain reach for this peculiar tool? The UCLA work points toward emotion regulation, particularly in the face of overwhelming uncertainty. Think of the last time you waited for important news—test results, a job offer, a call from a hospital. Did you find yourself cleaning your apartment with furious focus, or organizing your bookshelf by color, or checking your email every 90 seconds? These are not profitable actions. They are, in the moment, compulsive. But they are also profoundly functional. They give your anxious mind a concrete task, a tiny domain it can control absolutely when the larger, important domain is utterly out of your hands. The compulsive behavior is a pressure valve, a way to prevent the emotional system from overheating.

Now, take this logic out of the therapist’s office and drop it onto the baseball diamond. The sport is a statistically brutal lesson in failure and chance. The very best hitters fail to get on base two out of every three tries. Entire games, seasons, and careers can hinge on a bad bounce. Is it any wonder that baseball is a cathedral of compulsion? Batters adjust their gloves the same way before every pitch. Pitchers touch the brim of their cap in a specific sequence. These are not idle habits. They are meticulously performed scripts designed to carve out a moment of ritualized certainty between pitches, to reset the mind for the next encounter with chaos. The anthropologist might call it superstition. The neuroscientist, following the UCLA thread, might call it elegant, real-time emotional regulation.

This is where our common understanding of “bad habits” breaks down completely. A habit, in the classical sense, is automatic. It’s running on a mental shortcut to save energy. You drive the same route to work without thinking. You bite your nails while reading. But the compulsive ritual before the board meeting or at the batting box is different. It is *hyper*-attentive. It is deliberate. It *must* be performed correctly to “work.” Its value lies not in efficiency, but in the precise feeling of control it manufactures. It is a cognitive tool, not a cognitive glitch.[^2]

Let’s return to our venture capitalist on the park bench. From the outside, it looks like a wasteful quirk. But through this new lens, we see a man engineering his own state of mind. The walk is a physical transition from one realm (the office of abstract figures and future projections) to another (the tangible world of street food and city sounds). The act of eating is visceral and present. The specificity of the order—two dogs, with everything—creates a predictable, repeatable outcome in a day defined by unpredictable negotiations. He is not succumbing to a habit. He is conducting a personal ceremony to regulate the anxiety of high stakes, to create the calm necessary for clarity. He is, in a very real sense, performing a psychological technology older than any app on his phone.

We have spent decades trying to cure people of their compulsions. What if we’ve been asking the wrong question? The question isn’t “How do we stop this behavior?” but “What chaos is this behavior trying to manage?” The ritual isn’t the fire. It’s the fire alarm. And sometimes, the smartest thing you can do is not to silence the alarm, but to go see what’s burning.

[^1]: The study distinguishes between *habit-based* behaviors, which are triggered automatically by cues and performed with decreasing conscious attention, and *compulsion-based* behaviors, which are driven by a desire to relieve an internal state of distress or anxiety. The key difference is in the driver: a cue in the world versus a pressure in the mind.

[^2]: This distinction echoes much older observations from the animal kingdom. Ethologists documented “displacement activities” in birds—like preening obsessively during a tense standoff with a rival. The action is irrelevant to the fight (it’s not preparing them for combat), but it appears to modulate their arousal. Our compulsions may be the highly sophisticated human version of a bird nervously grooming its feathers.
