SUBJECT LINE: Why Batman Makes Us Better People

It began, as so many strange and wonderful things do, with a costume and a question. A few years ago, a team of psychologists led by a researcher named Nicholas Epley wanted to understand something peculiar about human nature. They didn’t set up their lab in a university basement. Instead, they went to a series of shopping malls and public parks around Chicago, and they enlisted parents for a simple, if unusual, task. The parents were told to tell their children, aged four to six, that they had important work to do for ten minutes. The children were left with a repetitive, boring activity on a tablet. And then came the intervention. Some children were told to spend those ten minutes asking themselves, “Am I working hard?” Others were told to ask themselves the same question, but in the third person, using their own name. And a final group was given a small prop—a cape, a mask—and told to ask the question not as themselves, but as a character. *Is Batman working hard?*

The results were startling. The children who had been given the chance to *become* Batman, or Dora the Explorer, or any other heroic figure they chose, spent significantly more time on the tedious task. They were more focused, more persistent. The researchers called it the “Batman Effect.” When we step outside ourselves and embody a paragon of virtue or competence, even in the flimsiest of costumes, we tap into a reserve of willpower we didn’t know we had. It’s a delightful finding, a piece of psychological magic that feels both counterintuitive and instantly familiar. But then the researchers asked a deeper, more unsettling question. If pretending to be a hero makes a child more diligent, what might it make an adult do?

We like to think that our moral choices—to help, to intervene, to do the right thing—spring from a deep, internal well. Our character. Our conscience. It’s a comforting story, one that places the engine of goodness squarely within us. We are the heroes of our own stories because we choose to be. But there’s a problem with that theory. It fails, utterly, to explain the chaos of the real world, where good people so often stand by and do nothing.

Take a moment and put yourself in this scenario. You’re walking through a park. You see a man slumped on a bench, not moving. Do you stop? Do you check on him? What if you’re late for a meeting? What if you tell yourself someone else will help, someone more qualified? Your internal monologue, the debate between your better angels and your practical demons, feels intensely personal. It is the very essence of *you* making a choice. But what if that monologue isn’t the main character in this story? What if it’s just a bit player, reciting lines written by the set, the costumes, and the role you’ve unconsciously been assigned?

To understand the power of the Batman Effect on our morality, we have to go back to a much darker chapter in psychology, one that seemed to prove we are not heroes at all, but sheep. In the early 1960s, the shocking murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, New York, was reported as a tale of profound civic failure—thirty-eight witnesses who saw or heard the attack and did nothing. Psychologists Bibb Latané and John Darley were consumed by this story. They began a series of experiments that led to the formulation of the “bystander effect.” Their central, chilling finding was that the *more* people who witness an emergency, the *less* likely any one person is to help. Responsibility diffuses. We look to others to see how to react, and in that silence, we all assume inaction is the correct response. It was the anti-Batman Effect. It wasn’t that people were heartless; it was that the context of a crowd made them less likely to access their own courage.

This was the dominant, pessimistic view for years: situation crushes character. The most infamous demonstration came from Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford prison experiment in 1971, where ordinary college students, assigned the roles of “guard” or “prisoner” in a mock basement prison, descended into cruelty and submission with terrifying speed. The costume of the guard—the uniform, the mirrored sunglasses—wasn’t playful; it was a license for brutality. The role made the man. This was the lesson seared into a generation: give a person a role, a uniform, a tiny slice of power, and you can unmoor their moral compass entirely.

So we are left with a paradox. One set of experiments shows a costume can make a child persist at a boring task—a small, positive act of will. Another, more famous set shows a costume or a role can make adults commit or permit atrocities. Is the costume—the external marker of an identity—a force for good or for evil? The answer, it turns out, isn’t in the costume itself. It’s in the script that comes with it.

This brings us back to Epley and his colleagues and their new field experiment. They wondered if the Batman Effect could be weaponized for altruism. They returned to the real world, this time to a series of Halloween events. They set up a simple booth where children could play a game to earn candy for themselves. Nearby, clearly visible, was a donation bowl for a local food bank. The researcher running the booth would casually mention that any extra candy could be donated to “other children who are less fortunate.” Then came the critical variable. Some children were simply asked, “Will you help?” Others were asked, “Will Batman help?”[^1]

The children who were asked to channel Batman donated significantly more of their hard-earned candy. They weren’t just donating *as* themselves; they were donating *through* the persona of a hero. The cape and mask weren’t just fabric and plastic; they were a psychological portal to a self that was more generous, more just, more capable of rising above the immediate desire for a few more sweets. The role didn’t corrupt; it elevated. It provided a script for virtue.

And then something even stranger happened. The effect wasn’t confined to the child in the Batman cowl. The researchers found that the *parents* of these children, watching their son or daughter embody a hero and act generously, became more generous themselves. When the researcher made the same pitch for donations to the parents, those who had just watched their child participate as Batman gave more than parents whose children had not. The heroism was contagious. The performance of virtue by one person, especially a child, created a new social script for everyone present.

This is the hidden link between the bystander effect and the Batman Effect. Both reveal that we are not autonomous moral actors. We are interpreters of social context. The crowd in the Kitty Genovese case provided a script of inaction. The guard’s uniform in the Stanford prison provided a script of domination. But the Batman cape provides a script of heroism. Our internal monologue is often just us reading the lines we’ve been given, trying to figure out what our role in this particular scene requires. The profound insight of this new research is that we can *choose* our role. We can, quite literally, put on the cape. Or, more practically, we can ask ourselves the simple question: “What would a hero do in this situation?”[^2]

It feels silly. It feels like a child’s game. But that’s the point. The psychological distance it creates—the separation between “me, who is tired and selfish and late” and “Batman, who is courageous and selfless”—is the very thing that allows our better nature to speak up. It bypasses the ego, the insecurity, the diffusion of responsibility. It gives us permission to be good.

So the next time you see someone in need and feel that familiar hesitation, that internal debate about getting involved, try a little psychological judo. Don’t ask if *you* should help. You might be tired, or skeptical, or afraid. Instead, ask what someone else would do. Not just anyone. Ask what Batman would do. Or Wonder Woman. Or your grandmother. Or that one incredibly decent friend you have. Step outside of yourself for a second. The hero you need to summon might not be in the mirror. It might be in the mask you decide to wear, if only in your mind.

[^1]: The researchers were clever in their design. They didn't force the identity; they offered a selection of heroic and non-heroic characters (like Batman, but also a princess) to ensure the child could connect with a figure they admired. The effect held strongest for "heroic" archetypes.

[^2]: This is a secular, psychological cousin to the age-old question "What would Jesus do?" which serves the same function for believers: creating psychological distance from the immediate, selfish impulse and providing a clear script for virtuous action drawn from an idealized identity.
