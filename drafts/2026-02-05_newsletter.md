SUBJECT LINE: Why Your AI Thinks Like a Victorian Explorer

We need to start with a wedding in Lagos. Earlier this year, a bride-to-be—let’s call her Chioma—asked a popular AI chatbot for help planning her traditional Yoruba ceremony. She wanted ideas for the alaga ijoko’s greetings, the sequence of the money spray, the specific foods for the reception. The AI’s response was polite, enthusiastic, and utterly useless. It suggested a white wedding cake, a father-daughter dance, and a seating chart for the rehearsal dinner. It was drafting a blueprint for a ceremony in Ohio, not one in Oyo State. Chioma laughed it off, a minor digital annoyance. But that moment, repeated in countless forms from Jakarta to Johannesburg, points to something far more profound. Our most powerful new technology speaks with a distinct and narrow accent.

We assume artificial intelligence is a mirror. We feed it the messy, glorious totality of human knowledge and out comes a neutral, global brain. It’s a comforting idea—the machine as a great equalizer, a frictionless translator between cultures. But here’s the problem with that theory: mirrors have frames. And the frame holding up our current AI is unmistakably Western. A significant new study led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, puts hard data to Chioma’s experience. They systematically tested large language models like GPT-4 and Llama 2 on a battery of questions designed to probe cultural reasoning. The models weren’t just bad at answering questions about non-Western contexts; they exhibited a powerful, default tendency to assume Western perspectives, values, and even facts as the universal norm. When asked about social norms, family structures, or everyday objects, the AI’s worldview was overwhelmingly shaped by what you might call the “Anglophone internet.”[^1]

It turns out, to understand why an AI in 2024 gives wedding advice fit for a 1990s sitcom, you have to go back to the digital soil in which it was grown. The story doesn’t start with Silicon Valley code, but with the accidental archaeology of the early internet. When the web began its explosive growth in the 1990s, its content was created by a tiny, unrepresentative slice of humanity: predominantly English-speaking, based in North America and Europe, and highly educated. This digital fossil record—the blogs, the early websites, the forums, the vast libraries of digitized books and news archives—became the foundational bedrock for training AI. The models we have today aren’t just trained on the present internet; they are trained on the *accumulated* internet, a historical artifact with its own baked-in prejudices and blind spots. They didn’t learn culture from a balanced global curriculum. They learned it from a specific, noisy, and skewed century of textual output.

So we end up with a strange inheritance. The AI has absorbed the implicit cultural priorities of its training data. It’s better at discussing individualism than communalism, nuclear families than extended clans, hamburgers than *jollof rice*. Its moral reasoning often defaults to a liberal Western framework. This isn’t a programming bug or a malicious design. It’s a historical echo. The model, in its relentless pattern-matching, has concluded that the most frequent perspectives in its dataset are, in fact, the most correct—or worse, the only ones that exist. It has statistically inferred that the world looks a certain way because, for decades, the people most loudly describing it online came from a certain set of places.

Let’s play a quick game. Think of the most generic, inoffensive person you can imagine. What do they eat for breakfast? Where do they live? What does their living room look like? If you’re like most people—and most AI—you just conjured an image that is quietly, overwhelmingly Western. That’s the default setting. Now imagine you are that AI. Every time you face a question with a gap in context, you must fill it with something. You reach into your vast memory and pull out the most statistically common association. The result is a kind of soft cultural imperialism, delivered not by force but by statistical likelihood.

The consequences are subtle and pervasive. When an AI helps draft a business plan, it might assume regulatory and financial norms that don’t apply in Kenya. When it acts as a tutor for a student in Bangladesh, its examples and analogies might be alienating. When it is used to filter job applications or grade essays, its sense of what “good” writing or a “strong” candidate looks like is filtered through a specific cultural lens. The risk isn’t just irrelevance, like the wedding advice. It’s the silent reinforcement of a single worldview as the default standard. The technology that promises to connect us is, in a way, reconstructing the very cultural hierarchies that many hoped it would dismantle.

This brings us back to Chioma and her wedding. Her moment of friction wasn’t just an error. It was an archaeological discovery. The AI’s response was a fossil—a preserved imprint of the world as seen from a particular coordinate in history and geography. It revealed that our “global” AI is, for now, a deeply local one, wearing a global mask.

We are often told that AI will shape the future. But this study reminds us, powerfully, that it is also shackled to the past. It is a product of history, carrying forward the imbalances and omissions of the era that built its database. The challenge isn't merely to tweak an algorithm. It’s to perform a kind of digital repatriation, to actively seek out and feed the models the stories, the contexts, the knowledge that the early internet left out. Because a tool that only knows one version of the world is not intelligent. It’s just well-read in a very small library.

[^1]: The researchers created a benchmark called **CulturaX**, testing the models on over 100,000 prompts across seven cultural domains: reasoning, social norms, values, storytelling, metaphor, humor, and facts. The performance gap wasn't minor; models consistently performed best when the cultural context was American or Western European, and their attempts to answer questions outside that frame often revealed deep logical inconsistencies or flat omissions.
