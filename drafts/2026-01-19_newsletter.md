SUBJECT LINE: The Medical Device That's Quietly Lying to You

In the spring of 2023, a man named Prashant Katikar walked into a clinic in San Francisco feeling unwell. A nurse clipped a pulse oximeter—that familiar, glowing plastic clothespin—onto his finger. The screen blinked a reassuring 96%. His blood oxygen saturation, a critical vital sign, was perfectly normal. But Prashant felt terrible. He was dizzy, short of breath, and his instincts screamed that something was wrong. He pushed for a more invasive test, an arterial blood gas draw, where a needle pulls blood directly from an artery. That test told a different story: his actual oxygen level was a dangerous 88%. The device on his finger had been off by a life-altering eight points. For Prashant, who has dark skin, this wasn't just a glitch. It was a pattern.[^1]

We trust these little gadgets implicitly. They are the first line of defense in emergency rooms, the silent sentinels in overnight hospital wards, and the at-home peace of mind for millions during respiratory seasons. Their soft red glow is a universal symbol of medical vigilance. The assumption is bedrock: a number is a number. Technology is objective. If it says 96%, you are 96% oxygenated, whether your skin is pale or dark. But that’s not quite right.

In January 2026, the FDA released the results of a long-awaited, agency-funded study on pulse oximeter accuracy, and the findings were both surprising and deeply confusing. Researchers tested how well these devices worked on people with a wide range of skin tones. The outcome wasn't a simple headline. It was a riddle. Some devices, even those recently cleared by the FDA, performed poorly on people with darker skin. Others did okay. There was no consistent brand or model that was reliably accurate for everyone. The technology, it seemed, wasn't uniformly broken or uniformly fixed. It was a crapshoot. As one researcher involved told STAT News, the results were “sobering” and a “call to action.”

So here is the central question: How did a device that is wrong often enough to matter become so ubiquitous, so trusted, and so embedded in our standard of care?

To understand that, we need to rewind the story. The pulse oximeter is a technology of light. It works by shining red and infrared light through your fingertip and measuring how much is absorbed. Oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood absorb light differently. The device calculates a ratio and spits out a percentage. The problem, which researchers have quietly known for decades, is that skin pigment—melanin—also absorbs light. For the algorithm inside the machine, melanin can look a lot like deoxygenated blood. It’s a case of technological confusion. The machine is *trying* to be objective, but its fundamental method is biased by a variable it wasn't fully calibrated to recognize.

This isn't a new revelation. A 2022 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* found that Black patients were nearly three times more likely than white patients to have occult hypoxemia—dangerously low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximetry. But the 2026 FDA study adds a critical, frustrating layer. It shows that even our attempts to fix the problem are haphazard. The marketplace is a patchwork. A doctor might buy one model for their clinic that works reasonably well across skin tones, while the hospital across town might use a different brand that fails its darker-skinned patients silently. There is no easy list for a hospital administrator to consult.

Which brings us back to Prashant Katikar. His story is the human container for this data. He is not a statistical outlier; he is a predictable outcome. When he looked at that falsely reassuring number, he was facing a cascade of hidden history. He was confronting a device that was likely designed and tested primarily on lighter-skinned individuals. He was up against an entire medical system that had adopted a flawed tool as gospel. His decision to trust his body over the machine wasn't just intuition; it was a necessary rebellion against a baked-in bias.

Imagine for a moment that your thermometer consistently read two degrees lower if you had red hair. Or that your car’s fuel gauge was less accurate for people over six feet tall. The outrage would be immediate, the recall swift. But because the error is tied to race, and because it lives inside the black box of a medical algorithm, it has persisted for generations. It is a perfect example of how a system can be neutral in intent but discriminatory in effect. The pulse oximeter doesn't *know* it's biased. It just is.

The 2026 study’s confusion is the point. The surprise isn't that the problem exists—the alarm bells have been ringing for years. The real surprise is that after all the headlines, after the FDA’s own public meetings and warnings, the marketplace is still a Wild West of accuracy. A patient’s safety should not depend on the blind luck of which brand their hospital purchased. The synthesis here is chilling: sometimes, the most dangerous bias is the one we’ve already measured, acknowledged, and then left sitting on the shelf, waiting for the next person to walk into a clinic, feeling unwell, and trust a little green number that doesn’t trust them back.

[^1]: Prashant’s experience was documented in a 2023 report by KQED, highlighting the very real, life-threatening consequences of this technological bias. His advocacy is part of what pushed for greater scrutiny.

[^2]: The pulse oximeter was invented in the 1970s. Its revolutionary promise was non-invasive, continuous monitoring. That promise was so powerful that it overshadowed the slow accumulation of evidence about its flaws. Speed of adoption often outpaces depth of understanding.

[^3]: Research from the University of Virginia in 2020 even suggested that correcting for these biases could have dramatically changed treatment protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially allowing earlier, life-saving intervention for thousands of patients of color.
