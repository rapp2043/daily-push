SUBJECT LINE: Why Treating Everyone the Same Makes Things Worse

In the spring of 2026, a marketing director at a mid-sized tech firm—let’s call her Anya—faced a dilemma. Her company had just released its annual diversity report, and the numbers were, as the press politely termed it, “aspirational.” The leadership wanted a campaign. Not just any campaign, but one that loudly proclaimed their commitment to equality. The directive was simple: create ads that show everyone being treated exactly the same. No special mentions, no targeted messaging—just a universal, color-blind, gender-neutral portrayal of their product solving universal problems. It felt right. It felt fair. It was, according to a study published that January in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, precisely the wrong thing to do.

The study presented a fascinating paradox. Researchers created two versions of ads for a fictional company. One set highlighted the company’s commitment to equal treatment for all. The other set made no mention of equality, focusing solely on product features. They showed these ads to a broad sample of participants and then measured their perceptions. The results were startling. When members of historically marginalized groups saw the “equal treatment” ads, their trust in the company *dropped*. They were more skeptical of the company’s motives and less likely to believe it would be a fair place to work. The ads designed to signal fairness had backfired. For Anya, and for anyone who believes a simple appeal to sameness is the antidote to bias, this presents a puzzle. How can promising not to see difference make people feel less seen?

But here’s the problem with the theory of sameness. It assumes a level playing field that doesn’t exist. It assumes that a policy of blindness is a form of justice. We like this idea. It’s clean, simple, and absolves us of the messy work of history. If we just treat everyone identically, the logic goes, the outcomes will eventually be fair. It is a comforting story. And it is a story that has been failing quietly for decades.

Consider a much earlier attempt to engineer fairness through identical treatment. In the mid-20th century, as the civil rights movement challenged Jim Crow, a powerful idea took hold in liberal circles: the “color-blind” constitution. The goal was noble—to build a society where race simply didn’t matter. But as legal scholar and critical race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw has argued, this doctrine of blindness often served to entrench inequality. If you cannot see race, you cannot see racism. You cannot remedy a specific historical disadvantage if your only tool is a universal promise. A law that says “no one may be discriminated against” sounds equitable, but it is powerless against a system built on generations of exclusion that now operates through coded language and inherited wealth.[^1] The promise of sameness, in this light, starts to look less like a solution and more like a form of neglect.

This is where the psychology of the advertisement meets the psychology of the street. Social psychologists have long known that generic appeals to fairness ring hollow to those who experience the world as unfair. The late Susan Fiske, a pioneering researcher at Princeton, spent her career mapping how we perceive others. Her work on stereotypes and prejudice revealed that often, the most damaging bias isn’t overt hostility, but something subtler: a failure to differentiate. When we lump people into a monolithic “other” and claim to treat them all the same, we are not seeing their individual needs, struggles, or histories. We are engaging in a form of cognitive laziness. The ad that says “we treat everyone equally” can, to a person who has fought for specific recognition, sound an awful lot like “we can’t be bothered to understand you.”

So what happens instead? Let’s play a game. Imagine you are hiring for a role and have two final candidates. One comes from a privileged background, with a resume polished by expensive schools and networks. The other has a scrappier history, having navigated systemic barriers to achieve comparable skills. You decide to be “fair” by evaluating them on identical, neutral criteria. Who benefits from this sameness? Almost invariably, the first candidate. The supposedly neutral criteria—prestige of degree, specific jargon, certain cultural references—are themselves products of a system. The equal treatment reinforces the existing hierarchy. Now translate that to an advertisement. An ad that showcases a generic, one-size-fits-all user is not speaking to someone for whom access has never been generic. It is speaking past them.

History offers a clearer path. In the 1990s, the Australian government confronted a crisis of distrust in its tax authority. The system was seen as rigid and punitive. Enter John Braithwaite, a criminologist. He proposed a radical idea: replace blanket enforcement with what he called “responsive regulation.” The authority would explicitly *not* treat everyone the same. For first-time, small-scale offenders, they offered help and education. For repeat, deliberate evaders, they came down with the full force of the law. The result? Compliance skyrocketed, and trust in the system improved dramatically. The lesson wasn’t that rules didn’t matter. It was that fairness is not the same as uniformity. Fairness is contextual. It considers circumstance. A promise of equal treatment sounds like you will be ignored. A promise of equitable treatment sounds like you will be heard.

This brings us back to the baffled marketing director, Anya, and that 2026 study. The researchers didn’t just identify a problem; they hinted at a solution. In follow-up experiments, they found that ads which acknowledged diversity and a commitment to equitable outcomes—ads that said, in effect, “we see difference and are building a system to support it”—did not backfire. They built trust. The message that resonated was not “we treat everyone the same,” but “we are building a place where everyone can succeed.” It is the difference between claiming blindness and demonstrating sight.

We have been seduced by the elegance of sameness. It is easier to proclaim neutrality than to do the hard work of designing for equity. It is easier to make an ad showing a blur of undifferentiated faces than to craft a message that speaks to specific lived experiences. But the research, and the long arc of history, suggests that this easy path is a dead end. Fairness isn’t about applying the same rule to everyone on a crooked floor. It’s about acknowledging the crookedness, and building a better floor.

So what should Anya do? She should put aside the ad copy about universal treatment. Instead, she might tell a story. Perhaps the story of the company’s mentorship program for first-generation engineers, or its flexible parental leave policy designed by actual parents. She should make a specific promise, not a vague one. Because in the end, people don’t trust a declaration of color-blindness. They trust someone who looks at the world, sees it clearly—in all its uneven and unjust glory—and says, “We are working to fix this part right here.”

[^1]: This tension between color-blind ideals and race-conscious remedies has defined decades of American jurisprudence, most notably in Supreme Court cases on affirmative action. The compelling paradox is that to achieve the goal of a society where race *doesn’t* matter, we must, for a time, pay close attention to where it *does*.
[^2]: The most effective advertising has often been *aspirational* in a targeted way. Think of Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign, which was broadly inspirational but executed through the specific, gritty stories of athletes from all backgrounds. It didn’t say “we treat all athletes the same.” It said, “we see your specific struggle, and we’re here for it.”
[^3]: This principle shows up in unexpected places. The great general practitioner and writer Atul Gawande once noted that the most effective doctors don’t treat every patient with the same disease identically. They adjust treatments based on a patient’s specific biology, lifestyle, and beliefs. Standardization can be efficient, but personalization is often what creates trust and, ultimately, a cure.
