SUBJECT LINE: The Machine That Slows Down the Police

It was a hot Tuesday night in Chicago’s 11th District when Officer Rodriguez’s dashboard terminal lit up with a pair of alerts, thirty seconds apart. The first was a ShotSpotter alert: a computer algorithm, analyzing sounds from a network of street-corner microphones, had declared a probable gunshot on South Pulaski Road. The second was a 911 call from a resident in the same area, reporting the same sound. Rodriguez, seasoned and skeptical, had to make a choice in seconds. Which alert deserved his immediate, urgent response? He hit the lights and siren, racing toward the address given by a frightened human voice. He ignored the one generated by the machine.

We think of police work as being driven by human reports—the frantic 911 call, the eyewitness statement. But over the last decade, in over 150 cities across the United States, a new, mechanical witness has taken the stand. It’s called ShotSpotter, a system of acoustic sensors that listens for the crack of gunfire, triangulates its location, and alerts police dispatchers, often within a minute. Its promise is one of pure, technological efficiency: remove human error, remove the fear that keeps people from calling 911, and get police to the scene of violence faster than ever before. It is, in essence, a machine built to save time.

But there’s a problem with that theory. It turns out the machine might be making things slower.

In September 2024, researchers at the University of Michigan published a startling finding. After analyzing over 200,000 emergency calls in a major American city that uses ShotSpotter, they discovered a curious pattern. When a ShotSpotter alert and a 911 call came in for the same incident, police actually took *longer* to arrive than if they had only received the 911 call. The very technology designed to speed them up was applying a subtle brake. This isn’t a story about a gadget failing to work. This is a story about a gadget working exactly as designed, and in doing so, revealing a profound tension between the logic of machines and the chaos of human emergencies. The failure, it seems, comes in three distinct flavors.

First, there is the problem of **the crying wolf**. ShotSpotter is sensitive. According to analyses, including one by the City of Chicago’s Inspector General in 2021, the system frequently misidentifies sounds—backfiring cars, fireworks, construction noise—as gunshots. These false alerts create a background hum of suspicion. For officers like Rodriguez, every ShotSpotter alert carries an unspoken question: Is this real, or is it just the machine getting confused again? This skepticism introduces a hesitation, a momentary pause for triage that doesn’t exist with a panicked human voice on the 911 line. The human voice, for all its potential inaccuracy, carries the undeniable weight of another person’s fear. The machine’s synthesized report carries only the weight of its own algorithm, an algorithm the officers on the street have learned to doubt.

Second, there is the problem of **the wrong address**. A 911 caller can say, “It came from the alley behind the red brick building.” ShotSpotter, for all its technical precision, often provides a latitude and longitude that translates to the middle of an intersection or the center of a large apartment block. The location can be off by dozens of yards. In a dense urban landscape, that’s the difference between an alley, a street, and a living room window. When police arrive at a ShotSpotter pin-drop, they frequently find nothing and must spend crucial minutes fanning out, searching for shell casings or a point of origin. A human caller, however imperfect, can provide contextual clues no microphone can capture. The machine gives coordinates; the human gives a story. And in the first chaotic minutes after a shooting, the story is often a faster path to the truth.

Third, and perhaps most critically, there is the problem of **the diverted gaze**. Imagine you are a police dispatcher. Two alerts hit your screen nearly simultaneously for what is likely the same event. One is a flashing, automated box from a expensive, city-contracted technology system. The other is a ringing telephone line. Which one demands your immediate procedural focus? The system itself creates a bureaucratic imperative. There is evidence that the arrival of a ShotSpotter alert can actually slow down how quickly dispatchers process the accompanying 911 call, as they work to log and reconcile the two inputs. The technology doesn’t just alert the police; it redirects the attention of the human system meant to manage the police. It adds a step where the goal was to remove friction.

Now, consider a counterpoint. In some contexts, the machine *does* seem to help. Research from Atlanta has shown that ShotSpotter alerts, by themselves, can lead to faster police responses in certain high-risk areas, particularly when no 911 call is made. This is the technology’s core promise fulfilled: responding to shootings that would otherwise go unreported. But this success exists in a vacuum. The Michigan study suggests that the benefits of these solo alerts are mathematically erased—and then some—by the slowdown that occurs when the machine and a human call about the same thing. The net effect, in the messy reality of a city where people do call 911, can be a net loss. The system is most effective in the silence it was designed to fill, and least effective amid the noise it actually encounters.

So what are we left with? We commissioned a mechanical witness to solve a human problem. But we failed to account for how the very presence of that witness would change the behavior of everyone else in the room—the dispatcher, the officer, even the civilian caller who now might assume the machine will do the work for them. We outsourced urgency to an algorithm and were surprised when the humans in the loop began to subconsciously discount its cries.

Back on South Pulaski, Officer Rodriguez found his 911 caller, a man pointing to a vacant lot. They found a single shell casing. The ShotSpotter alert’s coordinates had placed the origin a half-block away, near a busy intersection. The dispatch log would show a response time several minutes longer than the district average for a shots-fired 911 call with no technology assist. Rodriguez didn’t know about the Michigan study or the net-speed calculus. He only knew, in his gut, which signal he trusted more that night. He had chosen the human over the machine. And in doing so, against all intention, he had proven the machine’s most unintended consequence: sometimes, the fastest way forward is to ignore the shortcut.

[^1]: The financial cost is its own fascinating tangent. Chicago’s contract for ShotSpotter was valued at roughly $49 million over several years. This creates another layer of bureaucratic inertia—the pressure to justify a costly, high-profile technology can, perversely, lead to its findings being prioritized *because* they are expensive, not because they are accurate.
[^2]: This phenomenon has a cousin in other fields. In medicine, the over-ordering of highly sensitive diagnostic tests can lead to "alert fatigue" in clinicians, who start to overlook critical warnings amid a flood of false positives. We keep building systems to grab our attention, only to discover that human attention is a resource that depletes under bombardment.
