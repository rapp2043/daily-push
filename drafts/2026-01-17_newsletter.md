SUBJECT LINE: Why Planting Trees Can Sometimes Create More Water

The protestors arrived at the gates of Karura Forest on the northern edge of Nairobi just after dawn. It was January 1999, and they were led by a woman in a vibrant headscarf, a former professor named Wangari Maathai. The government had sent bulldozers and private developers to clear hundreds of acres of the public forest for luxury housing. Maathai and the women of the Green Belt Movement she founded stood in their path. They were beaten that day by hired guards; Maathai was bludgeoned and briefly knocked unconscious. But they held the line. The story of Maathai, who would later win the Nobel Peace Prize for her work, is often told as one of sheer courage and environmentalism. She famously mobilized communities to plant over 30 million trees across Kenya to combat deforestation. The assumption was simple and beautiful: trees are good, more trees are better, and saving a forest is an unalloyed victory for the land and the people. But there’s a problem with that theory, one that has quietly troubled water managers and hydrologists for decades.

The conventional wisdom goes like this. Trees are like straws stuck into the ground. They drink. A forest, with its deep, thirsty roots and vast canopy that intercepts rainfall, acts as a massive pump, moving water from the soil back into the atmosphere. Therefore, planting trees—or restoring lost forests—must reduce the amount of water flowing into streams, rivers, and ultimately, reservoirs. It’s a zero-sum game: more trees equals less water for people. This logic has become so entrenched that in some water-scarce regions, policymakers actively discourage large-scale reforestation. They look at a map of potential planting sites and see a future of parched riverbeds. The equation seems so intuitively correct that we’ve accepted it as a law of nature. But then something strange happened. Scientists began looking at the data from actual reforestation projects, and the story, like the roots of the trees themselves, turned out to be far more complicated.

Consider a review published in 2023 by UNESCO and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). The researchers sifted through decades of evidence on how forests influence river flow. What they found was startling. The old “forests drink water” narrative is, as they put it, an “overgeneralization.” In some cases, yes, planting certain kinds of trees in certain places can reduce water yields. But in many others, the opposite is true. A restored forest can *increase* the water available downstream. How could that be? The answer lies not in the leaves, but in the soil beneath them.

Think of the land not as a flat sponge, but as a complex, living infrastructure project. When trees are removed, the ground often hardens. Rain hits bare soil with force, compacting it, creating a crust that seals the surface. When the next downpour comes, the water can’t seep in; it races overland, carving gullies, carrying away the fertile topsoil in violent, muddy flashes, and leaving the groundwater table untouched. It’s a system built for flood and drought. Now, plant a forest. The first thing that happens isn’t that the trees drink. It’s that the leaf litter and roots create a soft, porous mattress on the forest floor. This organic layer absorbs the hammer-blow of raindrops. Fungal networks and earthworms—drawn by the roots—create microscopic channels. The water, instead of running away, is invited in. It infiltrates deep into the earth, recharging aquifers. This stored water then seeps out slowly, steadily, feeding springs and rivers long after the rains have stopped. The forest, in this light, isn’t just a pump. It’s a reservoir manager, a flood controller, and a master architect of the watershed.[^1]

Here’s a thought experiment. You have two identical hillsides in a dry region. One is bare, scarred by erosion. The other is covered by a mature, native forest. A heavy rainstorm hits both. On the bare hillside, you see a brown torrent rage down a gully and be gone in an hour. On the forested hillside, you might see no surface flow at all at first. But if you check the spring at the hill’s base weeks later, you’ll find it is still flowing clearly and coolly. Which landscape provided more usable water?

The type of tree, it turns out, matters enormously. The fear of water loss is most valid with fast-growing, non-native trees with high water use, like certain eucalyptus or pine plantations grown in rows for timber. They are the thirsty straws of legend. But native forest ecosystems, with their mix of species and deep, layered roots, often play this opposite, sponge-like role. A 2022 study of watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands, published in the journal *Ecohydrology*, found exactly this dichotomy. Plantations reduced streamflow. But natural forest regeneration improved infiltration and moderated flows, making water more reliably available throughout the year. The trees weren’t the enemy of the water cycle; they were its indispensable engineers.

This is where we return to Wangari Maathai and the saved Karura Forest. The fight wasn’t just about saving trees for the trees’ sake. Karura is a critical part of Nairobi’s hydrological system. The forest sits atop a major aquifer recharge zone. When it was threatened by clearing, the threat wasn’t merely aesthetic or ecological; it was a direct threat to the city’s water security. The bulldozers, by paving over the natural sponge, would have accelerated runoff, increased flooding in the city below during storms, and reduced the slow, steady seepage that replenishes the underground water stores that Nairobi relies on. Maathai’s intuition—that the forest’s value was woven into the survival of the community—was scientifically precise in a way she may not have fully articulated at the time. She wasn’t just planting trees. She was repairing broken water infrastructure.

And this forces a profound shift in how we view environmental restoration. We tend to silo our crises: here is a water shortage, here is a biodiversity loss, here is a climate problem. We look for single-purpose solutions—a dam for water, a protected area for wildlife. But the forest doesn’t operate in silos. The new understanding reveals that a native forest is a multi-tool. It sequesters carbon, houses countless species, *and* regulates the water supply, often making it more abundant and predictable. The choice isn’t between trees and water. In most cases, it’s between a brittle, unreliable landscape and a resilient, water-secure one. The old assumption that we must sacrifice water for green cover was not just incomplete; it was dangerously backwards. It encouraged us to preserve the very conditions—degraded, hardened land—that exacerbate water scarcity. The truth is, in the right place and with the right trees, you can plant a forest and watch the streams rise.

[^1]: This sponge effect is so powerful it has spawned an entire field of payment-for-ecosystem-services programs. In places like Costa Rica and New York City, water utilities pay upstream landowners to preserve or restore forests because it’s cheaper than building new filtration plants. The forest does the work for free.
