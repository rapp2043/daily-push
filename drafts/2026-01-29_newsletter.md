SUBJECT LINE: Why the Angriest Tweets Often Win the Least

It was late, the government was lurching toward another shutdown, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was scrolling. The congresswoman, known for her formidable social media presence, saw a post from a Republican colleague she found particularly galling. Her fingers flew. She composed a tweet that was pure, distilled fury—a rhetorical flare shot into the digital night. It felt true. It felt righteous. It felt like connecting. And then, she later confessed to The New Yorker, she’d often wake up the next morning with a pit in her stomach. “Did I just make everything worse?”[^1]

We live in the age of political emotion. The rulebook, written by a thousand viral moments and a million retweets, seems clear: to break through the noise, you must scream. Outrage generates attention. Authenticity—often a synonym for unfiltered passion—builds connection. Vulnerability fosters relatability. From the left’s moral fervor to the right’s defensive anger, the assumption is that turning up the emotional temperature is the surest path to a growing, engaged audience. It’s a logic that governs press releases, campaign strategies, and late-night posts from exhausted officials. But there’s a problem with that theory.

It turns out, our digital gut feelings about what works are profoundly, systematically wrong. A new study, slicing through the noise of hundreds of thousands of political tweets, arrives at a startling conclusion: politicians who consistently post highly emotional content don’t gain more followers. In many cases, they gain fewer. And when their audience is politically diverse, emotional tweets can actively backfire, eroding their digital coalition rather than strengthening it. The very fuel we thought powered the engine of online politics might, in fact, be sand in its gears.

The researchers, whose work was published earlier this year, did something deceptively simple. They analyzed over 1.7 million tweets from nearly 4,000 U.S. politicians. Using text analysis tools, they scored each tweet for its emotional intensity—both positive (enthusiasm, hope) and negative (anger, fear, disgust). Then they tracked what happened next. Did the politician’s follower count grow? The data presented a puzzle. There was no positive link between emotionality and follower growth. None. For negative emotion, the link was often negative. The more anger a politician broadcast, the more their growth stalled or diminished. The only faint glimmer was for positive emotion, which showed a tiny, inconsistent bump. The headline finding was one of absence: emotional rhetoric, especially the negative kind that dominates our feeds, is not a tool for building a broader audience. It’s a tool for speaking, ever more intensely, to the audience you already have.

So why does this happen? Why does the tactic that feels most potent so often fail? The answer lies in a clash between two different worlds of communication. Think of it this way: imagine you’re at a massive, crowded town hall. In one corner, a speaker is shouting, face red, pounding the podium about a single injustice. A tight circle of ardent supporters around them is cheering, amplifying every word. But the vast majority of the crowd, those milling in the middle or listening from other corners, instinctively takes a step back. The intensity is too much. It feels divisive, unstable, or simply exhausting. They may remember the shout, but they don’t move closer to the shouter. The digital town hall works the same way. Emotional content is potent *engagement* bait—it gets likes and retweets from existing allies—but it is terrible *outreach* bait for attracting new, curious followers from the periphery.

This isn’t just about metrics; it’s about human psychology. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University, has spent years studying how morality binds groups together—and blinds them to outsiders. Highly emotional moral rhetoric, he notes, acts as a tribal signal. It’s a powerful way to say “I am one of you” to your in-group. But to anyone outside that group, or even on its fringes, that same signal reads as “You are not one of us.” It’s a barrier, not a bridge. A tweet dripping with contempt for the other side might be candy for the base, but it is poison for anyone considering, even for a moment, whether to listen.

The study’s most fascinating wrinkle proves this point. The researchers found that the backfire effect of emotional tweets was strongest for politicians with politically *diverse* followers. When your audience contains a mix of people—some who agree, some who are skeptical—an emotional outburst doesn’t unify them. It polarizes them on the spot. It galvanizes the supporters and alienates the curious, leaving the politician with a more homogenous, and often smaller, group than before. The strategy that promises growth actually engineers shrinkage. It’s a political version of the Maithili proverb: you shout to bring the cattle home, and you end up scaring them all into the forest.[^2]

We can see this pattern etched in real time across the political spectrum. Look at the members of Congress with the most explosive, emotion-driven social media presences. Their names are well-known, their tweets frequently make headlines. But are they known for converting new voters or for preaching, with spectacular fervor, to a very specific choir? Their growth often plateaus, their influence becoming a kind of spectacular isolation. Meanwhile, some of the most consistently effective digital politicians—Barack Obama’s campaign, for instance—mastered a different tone: measured, hopeful, narrative-driven. They used emotion not as a cudgel but as an invitation. They understood that to grow a coalition, you must make people feel welcome, not besieged.

Here’s a thought experiment. Picture the most emotionally charged political tweet you saw this week. The one that made your blood boil or your heart swell with pride. Now, imagine you are a genuine undecided voter, weary of the noise. You have no team. You’re just trying to figure out who makes sense. Does that tweet pull you in? Or does it make you want to mute the entire conversation? For most of us, the honest answer is the latter. The emotional blast pushes us away. It solves the politician’s short-term need for catharsis or tribal affirmation at the cost of their long-term goal of persuasion.

Which brings us back to a congresswoman, staring at her phone in the dark. That pit in AOC’s stomach the morning after an emotional tweet is more than just personal doubt. It is a profound, human intuition of the study’s cold data. She senses the invisible step back taken by the person in the middle of the digital town hall. She feels the bridge burning as the tribe cheers. The new research simply confirms what that nervous feeling has been trying to say all along: in politics, the heat of the moment often wins the moment, but loses the future. The path to a wider audience isn’t forged by shouting louder into the chasm. It’s built by speaking, clearly and compellingly, across it.

Its methodology involved natural language processing of tweets from the years 2016-2022, correlating emotional scores with granular follower growth data.
