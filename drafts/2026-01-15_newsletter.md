SUBJECT LINE: Why the Most Glamorous Vacations Are Suddenly the Cheapest

In the spring of 2024, a software engineer named Anya was planning a getaway. Her friends were heading to typical budget locales—places known for hostels and street food. But Anya, scrolling through flight deals, noticed something odd. A round-trip ticket from New York to Lisbon, a city of pastel towers and coastal glamour, was hundreds of dollars cheaper than a flight to many less celebrated European capitals. It made no sense. Lisbon was *luxury*. It was the cover of travel magazines. Yet there it was, priced like a commodity. She booked it on a whim, half-expecting to find some hidden catch. The catch never came. She stayed in a charming *pensão* for a song, ate astonishing seafood without the astonishing bill, and returned home with a tan and a persistent question: why was a place that felt so expensive to be in, so inexpensive to get to?

We assume luxury is a walled garden, accessible only to those who can pay the steep entrance fee. A five-star hotel, a first-class seat, a Michelin-starred meal—these are the currencies of exclusivity. The travel industry is built on this simple equation: desire plus prestige equals high cost. It’s a system that seems rational, almost mechanical. But then a list like Skyscanner’s “Cheapest Vacation Hotspots of 2026” arrives, and the machine sputters. Nestled among the expected affordable havens are names like Portugal’s Algarve, Bali, and Cancún—places synonymous with luxury escapes. The algorithm isn’t broken. It’s revealing that the system we think is governed by cold economics is actually driven by something far more human: the fickle physics of social perception.

To understand why, we have to rewind three centuries. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ultimate luxury experience for a young British aristocrat was the Grand Tour—a years-long pilgrimage to the cultural heartlands of Europe.[^1] The destinations were fixed and exclusive: Paris, Rome, Venice, Florence. The goal wasn’t relaxation; it was cultural capital. To have seen the ruins of the Forum, to have commissioned a portrait in Rome, was to broadcast one’s refinement and wealth. This was luxury travel as a **signal**. It was prohibitively expensive, dangerously arduous, and thus, perfectly effective. The high cost *was the point*; it filtered out the masses and validated the status of the few. The system was elegant: exclusivity created desire, and desire justified the exclusive price.

But then something strange happened. The very mechanism that creates a luxury destination contains the seeds of its own devaluation. The economist Thorstein Veblen identified this pattern over a century ago, though he was writing about silver spoons, not spa resorts. He noted that the pursuit of “conspicuous consumption” follows a predictable cycle. An elite group adopts a practice or product for its symbolic value (the Grand Tour, the Swiss ski chalet). A wider, aspiring class sees this signal and desires it. Savvy entrepreneurs see this demand and work to make it more accessible. Suddenly, what was a marker of the ultra-wealthy becomes available to the upper-middle class. The original elite, seeing their signal diluted, abandon it for a new, more remote frontier. The luxury label remains glued to the original destination by habit and marketing, even as the price, chased by competition and scaled infrastructure, begins to tumble.

This is where Skyscanner’s data stops being a puzzle and starts being a map to this completed cycle. Think of Bali. For decades, it was the esoteric endpoint for surfers and spiritual seekers. Then it became a byword for bohemian luxury, a must-visit for celebrities and influencers. The signal was powerful: “Bali” meant you’d arrived at a certain level of cosmopolitan taste. The demand exploded. Flight routes multiplied. Villa construction boomed. The competition for tourist dollars became fierce, pushing prices down even as the Instagram imagery screamed “luxury.” The destination’s *psychological* price—its status value—remained high, while its *actual* price entered the realm of the affordable. The system isn’t about cost; it’s about the lag between perception and reality.

So here’s a thought experiment. Imagine you want to plan a trip that signals both taste and savvy. Do you choose the hot new destination that every finance bro is hyping (and pricing out), or the one that was all the rage five years ago? The data suggests the latter. The luxury filter has done its work: the hotels are built, the restaurants are world-class, the flight paths are established. The early adopters have moved on, chasing the next unspoiled signal. What they leave behind is a destination that is, in practical terms, better than ever—and desperate for your business. The prestige is baked in by memory, but the bill is dictated by present-day competition.

Anya, in Lisbon, was living in the sweet spot at the end of this Veblen cycle. She was sipping port where aristocrats once roamed, in a city that had completed its journey from exclusive European secret to mass-market darling, and had now settled into a new, sustainable identity: a formerly luxury destination that is, for a brief and wonderful window, a spectacular bargain. She wasn’t cheating the system. She was simply reading its output correctly. The cheapest vacation hotspots aren’t where luxury has never been; they’re where luxury has *already been*, and has quietly, efficiently, packed its bags and moved on.

[^1]: The term “Grand Tour” itself was popularized by Richard Lassels’s 1670 book *The Voyage of Italy*, which argued that no educated man’s schooling was complete without seeing the treasures of the continent. It was, in essence, the first luxury travel influencer guide.
[^2]: Thorstein Veblen was a notoriously eccentric figure. He wrote his seminal work, *The Theory of the Leisure Class*, while suffering from malaria and surviving on a diet of canned food, which perhaps sharpened his cynical view of societal displays of wealth.
