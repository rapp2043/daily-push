SUBJECT LINE: The Invisible Tax Hiding in Your Shopping Cart

It was the stainless steel that broke him. In early 2019, Josh Gellert, the president of a family-owned plumbing and heating supply company in Connecticut, watched the numbers on his screen with a sense of disbelief. A new tariff—a 25% tax on imports—had just hit a specific type of stainless steel from China. This wasn't a luxury good; it was a critical component for valves his company sold to hospitals, universities, and pharmaceutical labs. He could, in theory, stop sourcing from China. But the specialized tubing he needed wasn't made domestically in sufficient quantity or quality. So he paid the tax. Then he had a conversation with his customers. “I’d say, ‘Listen, this valve just went up 25%,’” Gellert recalled to a trade publication. The response was universal: “We don’t pay tariffs. That’s the vendor’s problem.” He was left holding the bill, caught between an unmovable supply chain and an immovable customer.

We like to think of tariffs the way politicians so often sell them: as a penalty we impose on foreigners. The language is martial and satisfying. We are *imposing costs* on China. We are *making Mexico pay*. The vision is of a ledger, where money owed by foreign companies gets wired directly into the U.S. Treasury. It’s a story of economic justice, where the offshorer finally gets his due. But there’s a problem with that theory. It turns out that ledger doesn’t exist.

For years, economists have treated this as a settled, if dull, question of tax incidence. A tariff is a tax on an imported good. And the basic rule of taxation is simple: the party that pays the tax is the one that can’t walk away. If you absolutely need that specialized stainless steel tubing, and there’s no alternative supplier, you pay the tax. If the Chinese factory can easily sell its tubing to someone in Germany instead, it doesn’t. The burden lands on the least flexible link in the chain. In 2019, a team of economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton, and Columbia decided to measure this directly. They tracked the prices of goods targeted by the Trump administration’s tariffs—everything from washing machines to aluminum—and compared them to equivalent non-targeted goods. What they found was startlingly one-sided. Nearly the entire cost of the tariffs was passed on to U.S. consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. Foreign exporters barely lowered their prices at all. The Americans, in other words, were paying the tax.[^1]

So why does this persist? If tariffs are effectively a self-inflicted tax hike on your own citizens, why do they remain such a durable tool, championed across the political spectrum? The answer lies in a kind of political magic trick, one that leverages a fundamental gap in how we perceive costs.

Consider a thought experiment. The government needs to raise revenue. Option one: announce a 25% national sales tax on new washing machines. Option two: announce a 25% tariff on imported washing machines. Economically, they are virtually identical for an American buyer. But politically, they are worlds apart. The sales tax is visible, controversial, and understood as coming from your wallet. The tariff is shrouded. Its cost is baked into the final price tag, mingled with the costs of materials, labor, and shipping. It feels like the *company’s* price, not the *government’s* tax. This opacity is its superpower. Research in political economy suggests that voters consistently fail to connect tariffs to their own cost of living, even as they angrily blame more transparent taxes.

This creates a perverse incentive. The political pain of imposing a tariff is low, because the cost is diffuse and hidden. The political benefit, however, can be high and immediate. You get to stand at a factory in Ohio and talk about standing up to Beijing. You get to promise the return of manufacturing jobs. The benefits are concentrated and visible—a photo op, a headline, a grateful union endorsement. The costs are scattered across millions of individual shopping carts and business balance sheets, like Josh Gellert’s, too small in each instance to spark outrage but colossal in aggregate.

And then something strange happened. Even as the economic data piled up, the rhetoric only hardened. The 2024 Economic Report of the President, citing that very research, explicitly acknowledged that “U.S. consumers and firms bore the burden of the tariffs.” Yet the same administration maintained most of them. The political logic had completely decoupled from the economic evidence. Tariffs had transitioned from a disputed tool of trade policy into something more potent: a symbol of national resolve. The actual financial transfer—from American consumers to the U.S. Treasury—became a secondary detail, the overlooked cost of a political statement.[^2]

This brings us back to a warehouse in Connecticut. Josh Gellert’s company didn’t go under. It adapted, absorbed costs, and found efficiencies elsewhere. But the money for that 25% tax had to come from somewhere. It came from lower margins, which meant less money for raises or new hires. Or it was eventually passed along, contributing to the slightly higher cost of maintaining a laboratory or a hospital. The tariff did not create a single new American job making that stainless steel tubing. It simply took money from one group of Americans and gave it to the government, all while allowing everyone to pretend the check was being written in Beijing. The magic trick worked because we wanted to believe the illusion: that you can tax a foreign country without your own citizens feeling a thing.

[^1]: The working paper, *The Impact of the 2018 Tariffs on Prices and Welfare*, is a classic example of meticulous economic detective work. The researchers used granular data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to perform a “difference-in-differences” analysis, comparing targeted to non-targeted goods. The clarity of the result was what made it so compelling to other economists and, eventually, to policymakers.
[^2]: This symbolic utility helps explain why the 2024 Republican Party platform advocated for a policy of “universal baseline tariffs on most foreign products,” a dramatic escalation of the concept. The economic feedback loop—where tariffs provoke retaliation and hurt export sectors—often takes years to manifest, well outside a political news cycle, while the announcement generates immediate symbolic gratification.
